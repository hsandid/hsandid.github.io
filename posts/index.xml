While I lacked skills in the field of programming or 2D/3D design at the start, I have been slowly making it up over the years by learning to use some popular tools.
These tools include :
Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (2D and 3D design) Visual Studio Code (C++ Programming) I have mainly used the Source Engine (tm) , which is a 3D engine developed by Valve Software, to bring my works to life.</description></item></channel></rss>
