Game design has been one of my favourite hobbies since High School. 

While I lacked skills in the field of programming or 2D/3D design at the start, I have been slowly making it up over the years by learning to use some popular tools. 

These tools include : 

- Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (2D and 3D design) 
- Visual Studio Code (C++ Programming)

I have mainly used the Source Engine (*tm*) , which is a 3D engine developed by Valve Software, to bring my works to life.
